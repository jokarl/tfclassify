# Governance Documentation

Creates and manages governance documents: ADRs for architectural decisions, CRs for requirement changes.

## Document Selection

| Need | Document | Guide |
|------|----------|-------|
| Technical/architectural decision | ADR | [reference/adr-guide.md](reference/adr-guide.md) |
| Requirement or scope change | CR | [reference/cr-guide.md](reference/cr-guide.md) |

## ADR Workflow

Use this checklist when creating an Architecture Decision Record:

```
- [ ] Read the template: templates/ADR.md
- [ ] Check docs/adr/ for the next available number
- [ ] Create file: docs/adr/ADR-NNNN-{short-title}.md
- [ ] Fill in all required sections
- [ ] Set status to "proposed"
```

**Strict requirements:**
- File naming: `ADR-NNNN-{title}.md` (four-digit number, lowercase, hyphens)
- Initial status: `proposed`
- Location: project's `docs/adr/` folder

**Flexible (adapt to context):**
- Level of detail in alternatives section
- Number of consequences listed
- Diagram inclusion (recommended for complex decisions)

## CR Workflow

Use this checklist when creating a Change Request:

```
- [ ] Read the template: templates/CR.md
- [ ] Check docs/cr/ for the next available number
- [ ] Create file: docs/cr/CR-NNNN-{short-title}.md
- [ ] Fill in all required sections
- [ ] Write acceptance criteria in Gherkin format
- [ ] Set status to "proposed"
```

**Strict requirements:**
- File naming: `CR-NNNN-{title}.md` (four-digit number, lowercase, hyphens)
- Initial status: `proposed`
- Location: project's `docs/cr/` folder
- Acceptance criteria: Gherkin format (Given-When-Then)
- Requirements keywords: RFC 2119 (MUST, SHOULD, MAY)

**Flexible (adapt to context):**
- Document length (minimum 250 lines for complex changes)
- Number of diagrams
- Depth of impact assessment

## Templates

- **ADR**: [templates/ADR.md](templates/ADR.md)
- **CR**: [templates/CR.md](templates/CR.md)

## Reference Guides

For detailed lifecycle information, best practices, and examples:

- **ADR Guide**: [reference/adr-guide.md](reference/adr-guide.md)
- **CR Guide**: [reference/cr-guide.md](reference/cr-guide.md)

## Checkpoint Workflow

Use this workflow to create iterative checkpoints during development:

```
- [ ] Analyze changes: git diff --staged, git diff, git ls-files --others
- [ ] Review and update .gitignore to exclude temporary files
- [ ] Write one-sentence summary and detailed body
- [ ] Stage all changes: git add -A
- [ ] Create checkpoint commit: checkpoint(CR-xxxx): {summary}
```

**Strict requirements:**
- Update `.gitignore` before staging to prevent repository bloat
- Commit format: `checkpoint(CR-xxxx): {summary}` with detailed body
- No destructive Git operations (reset, rebase, amend, force push)

**Squash merge output:**
- When merging, compress checkpoint commits into a single long-term memory message
- Use for PR descriptions or local squash merge commits

Full instructions: [reference/checkpoint.md](reference/checkpoint.md)

## Commit Message Format

Committing governance documents is the human's responsibility. When ready to commit, use these formats:

- **ADR**: `docs(adr): add ADR-NNNN {title}`
- **CR**: `docs(cr): add CR-NNNN {title}`
